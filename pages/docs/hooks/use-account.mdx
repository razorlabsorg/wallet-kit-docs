# useAccount

The `useAccount` hook provides a convenient way to access the current wallet account information 
and connection status. It combines data from the wallet adapter and chain configuration to give 
you a unified interface for working with the connected account.

## Usage

```tsx twoslash
import React from 'react'
import { useAccount } from '@razorlabs/razorkit';

function AccountInfo() {
  const { 
    address, 
    isConnected, 
    isConnecting, 
    chain 
  } = useAccount();
  
  if (isConnecting) {
    return <div>Connecting...</div>;
  }
  
  if (!isConnected) {
    return <div>Not connected</div>;
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Account Information</h2>
      <p>Address: {address}</p>
      <p>Network: {chain?.name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Return Value

The `useAccount` hook returns an object with the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `address` | `string \| undefined` | The address of the currently connected account |
| `addresses` | `string[]` | Array of all account addresses available in the wallet |
| `chain` | `Chain \| undefined` | The current chain configuration |
| `chainId` | `string \| undefined` | The ID of the current chain |
| `connector` | `WalletAdapter \| undefined` | The current wallet adapter instance |
| `status` | `"connected" \| "connecting" \| "disconnected" \| "error"` | The current connection status |
| `isConnected` | `boolean` | Whether the wallet is currently connected |
| `isConnecting` | `boolean` | Whether the wallet is currently connecting |
| `isDisconnected` | `boolean` | Whether the wallet is currently disconnected |
| `reconnecting` | `boolean` | Whether the wallet is currently reconnecting |

## Implementation Details

The `useAccount` hook combines data from two other hooks:
- [`useWallet`](/docs/hooks/use-wallet) - Provides wallet connection state and methods
- [`useChain`](/docs/hooks/use-chain) - Provides information about the current blockchain network

It also computes derived state like `isConnected`, `isConnecting`, and `isDisconnected` for convenience.
