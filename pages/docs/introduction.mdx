# Why Razor Kit? []

Razor Kit is an all-in-one React library that makes it easy to add wallet interaction to Movement dapps. 
It is easy to use, responsive and customizable.

## Features

### Wallet management

Out-of-the-box wallet management for your dapp. Aside from handling the connection 
and disconnection of wallets, Razor Kit supports all Movement-compatible wallets, 
provides wallet hooks, displays balance and much more!

### Customizable

You can tweak the Razor Kit UI to match your branding. You can build your own 
connection modals and buttons or customize the default components. For more advanced 
use cases, you can provide in a fully custom theme, render your own button and 
omit certain features.

### Industry standards
For better interoperability with most products, we rely on [@aptos-labs/ts-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aptos-labs/ts-sdk) 
and [@aptos-labs/wallet-standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aptos-labs/wallet-standard) â€” the most used libraries for Dapp and Wallet development
on AptosVM Move chains.

### Community
We're excited to see the community adopt Razor Kit, raise issues, and 
provide feedback. Whether it's a feature request, bug report, or a project 
to showcase, please get involved!
