# Migrating to v1.x.x

Gmove developers, We are proud to announce the Release of RazorKit v1.0.1 ü•≥ This release 
includes several exciting features, important improvements, and unfortunately, some 
breaking changes as well ü•≤ But don't worry, we have prepared a migration guide for 
you and your dapp to upgrade to this version smoothly ‚ù§Ô∏è

## What's New

### New Package Name

We've renamed the npm package from `@razorlabs/wallet-kit` to `@razorlabs/razorkit`. This is was done in order to
help users differentiate between the RazorKit and others. We believe that being easily recognizable and unique
is important for the success of RazorDAO as a brand. The most recent version (v.0.5.0) of the old package is still available
under the name `@razorlabs/wallet-kit`, but we recommend that all existing users migrate to the new package name as the old one will be deprecated soon.

### Chain Specific Language

Initially, RazorKit was designed to be a chain agnostic wallet kit. However, many things have changed since that time
and the Movement community has gravitated towards the AptosVM environment. As such, we deprecated support for Sui and
removed all chain specific naming conventions since Razor Kit only supports a single environment now. For example,
`useAptosWallet` is now `useWallet` and `<AptosWalletProvider>` is now `<WalletProvider>`. Developers need to take Note
of this change when upgrading to the new version.

### Wallet SDK export

With this new release, RazorKit now exports all functions and methods from the Wallet SDK from the `@razorlabs/wallet-sdk` package. This means that
developers who previously used both packages can now install only RazorKit and use the Wallet SDK functions directly.
