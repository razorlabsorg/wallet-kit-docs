# Getting Started [Get started with Razor Kit in just a few lines of code.]

Razor wallet kit is a wallet aggregator for DApps to interact with all wallets on Movement easily. ü•≥

Try out our kit and connect your dapp in just few seconds. ü™Ñ

‚≠êÔ∏è Have fun with our [Demo Playground](https://kit-demo.razorwallet.xyz/)

[Example repo](https://github.com/razorlabsorg/wallet-kit-vite-example)

You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why Razor Kit](/docs/introduction) section.


## üî® Setup
First of all, let's install the npm package @razorlabs/razorkit to your project.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @razorlabs/razorkit
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @razorlabs/razorkit
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @razorlabs/razorkit
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @razorlabs/razorkit
```

:::

Then wrap your `<App />` within one of our context provider, so that our hooks can work nicely inside your dapp.

Oh don't forget to import our css to enable default styles üé®

```tsx twoslash
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { WalletProvider } from '@razorlabs/razorkit';
import '@razorlabs/razorkit/style.css';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      Hello World
    </div>
  )
}

// take react project as an example
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <WalletProvider>
    <App />
  </WalletProvider>
);
```

By default, Razor Kit will load all the preset wallets to the listüí°

## üïπ Place ConnectButton
:::info
We recommend to use hooks together with our components. But if you want to use our hooks 
only with your customized UI components, follow the instructions in [Use Hooks Only](/docs/guides/use-hooks-only)
:::

Just import our `<ConnectButton />` and place it wherever you like, such as Navbar or Header sections.

```tsx twoslash
import React from 'react';
import { ConnectButton } from '@razorlabs/razorkit';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <ConnectButton/>
      </header>
    </>
  )
};
```

## ü™ù Use Wallet Capabilities
After your dapp connects to a supported wallet, your dapp is already supercharged and able 
to call wallet capabilities.üéâ

Please explore the docs for further usage information üí°

```tsx twoslash
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useWallet } from '@razorlabs/razorkit';

const App = () => {
  const wallet = useWallet()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!wallet.connected) return;
    console.log('connected wallet name: ', wallet.name)
    console.log('account address: ', wallet.account?.address)
    console.log('account publicKey: ', wallet.account?.publicKey)
  }, [wallet.connected])

  // launch a signMessage call for the connected account via wallet
  async function handleSignMessage() {
    await wallet.signMessage({
      message: "Hello World",
      nonce: '1',
    });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleSignMessage}>Sign Message</button>
    </div>
  )
};
```
