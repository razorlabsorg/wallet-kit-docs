title: Connect your DApp with wallets on Movement
sidebar_position: 2
---

When do we consider a web application a DApp? It's when the web app leverages smart contracts to provide services for users. Wallet plays an important role in this interaction where it connects users with DApps. So before you start to build something amazing, you need to connect your dapp with wallets.

[Razor Wallet Kit](https://kit.razorwallet.xyz/) is an all-in-one wallet connection toolkit for Movement DApps. With out-of-the-box UI components and well-defined utility functions, you can easily empower your dapp with the ability to interact with wallets in an elegant way.

In this tutorial, You'll see how easy it could be to connect your dapp with all the wallets in the Movement ecosystem using Razor Wallet Kit.

> Tips: Razor wallet kit only supports React.js projects for now.

## Learning Highlights

- Install and configure Razor Wallet Kit for a React-based DApp
- Connect the DApp with all the wallets on Movement
- Use wallet capabilities (display wallet status and account info, send transactions etc)

## Getting started

In this section, We will walk you through the installation and configuration for Razor wallet kit.

### Installation

> For simplicity, we choose npm as the package manager, feel free to change to any alternatives.

```shell
npm install @mysten/sui @razorlabs/wallet-kit
# or
npm install aptos @razorlabs/wallet-kit
```
From the next part onwards, we are going to assume that that you're trying to Connect an M2
App. If you're trying to follow this tutorial for an M1 app, just replace all instances of `Sui` with `Aptos`.

### Setup SuiWalletProvider for the App

Next, let's import the `SuiWalletProvider` and setup for your react project such that your App becomes available to access the states and functions provided by Razor Wallet Kit.

```jsx
// src/index.js
import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { SuiWalletProvider } from '@razorlabs/wallet-kit';

import App from './App';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(rootElement);

// wrap your app with WalletProvider
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <SuiWalletProvider>
      <App />
    </SuiWalletProvider>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

### Place ConnectButton

In Razor Wallet Kit, we provide out-of-the-box UI components in good designs. What you need to do is just import and place the `ConnectButton` to wherever you like.

## Connect to all the wallets on Movement

After the preparation above, we are ready to connect to wallets. Razor wallet kit provides a list of the most popular wallets in the Movement ecosystem. Users can choose their favorite one at their wish.

When we click the Connect Button, it would provide a list of preset wallets for users to choose.

Meanwhile, Razor wallet kit would automatically detect all the installed wallets that implement the wallet standard in the browser. So If the wallet is not installed, the kit would guide users to download it from Chrome Extension Store. Take Razor wallet as an example:

Let's move on. Now that the Razor wallet has been installed, the kit would initiate a connection request to the wallet extension.

Once user approves the request, the connection would be completed, which means we've successfully connected to a wallet!

## Use wallet capabilities

It's time to take a look at the most useful hook [useSuiWallet](https://kit.razorwallet.xyz/docs/Hooks/useSuiWallet). It retrieves all the properties and functions from [SuiWalletProvider](https://kit.razorwallet.xyz/docs/components/Suiwalletprovider), with which you can make use of the account properties and call functions to a connected wallet.

In the following sections, We will show you some basic usages with the hook `useSuiWallet`.

### Display info of the connected wallet

We can get several useful information from the connected wallet via Razor wallet kit:

- The wallet connection status
- The account info
- The current chain (network) that the wallet is using

Firstly let's display the connection status for the debugging purpose.

```jsx
import {
  SuiConnectButton,
  useSuiWallet,
  addressEllipsis,
} from '@razorlabs/wallet-kit';

export default function App() {
  // Get access to the connected wallet
  const wallet = useSuiWallet();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1 className="title">Hello, Razor Wallet Kit</h1>
      <SuiConnectButton />

      <section>
        <p>
          <span class="gradient">Wallet status:</span> {wallet.status}
        </p>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
}
```

For account info, we usually cares about the address of an account (it's like an ID in the blockchain world!). With the address of the user account, your dapp can get started to a series of work, such as querying user on-chain assets, initiating a transaction request etc. But let's start from the simplest thing: displaying the address of the account on the page.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const wallet = useSuiWallet();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      // ...
      {wallet?.account && (
        <div>
          <p>Connected Account: {addressEllipsis(wallet.account.address)}</p>
        </div>
      )}
      // ...
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that the address of an M2 account is a 64-character hex string, but usually we only need to display the first and last a few characters, so that is where the util function `addressEllipsis` comes to play.

Lastly, we need to know which chain that the wallet is using, that is important if we want to make interactions with the correct environment of Movement blockchain. Let's type in these codes:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  const wallet = useSuiWallet();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      // ...
      <p>
        <span class="gradient">Current chain of wallet: </span>
        {wallet.chain.name}
      </p>
      // ...
    </div>
  );
}
```

There you go! So far you should be able to play with the all the properties provided by the hook `useSuiWallet`.

> For more API references, please check out the documentation: https://kit.razorwallet.xyz/docs/Hooks/useSuiWallet#api-references.

### Execute a simple transaction

Now we've come to the most interesting part: sending transactions. With Sui SDK `@mysten/sui`, we are able to use [Programmable Transaction](https://docs.sui.io/testnet/build/prog-trans-ts-sdk), one of Suiâ€™s most powerful core developer primitives, to create any type of transactions to interact with smart contracts on Sui.

> For more details of Programmable Transaction, please check out this Sui doc: https://docs.sui.io/testnet/build/prog-trans-ts-sdk.

Again let's try this with a simple transaction, minting an NFT of Razor Logo.

![Gradient](/img/logo.png)

Here is a smart contract for creating an NFT with custom name, description and img url, you can find the contract on [M2 explorer (devnet)](https://explorer.sui.devnet.m2.movementlabs.xyz//object/0x2f60e33e33a1c880e8749073c5ef89288cf4df8974d8b872dfd72bc6c58f1172?network=devnet)

```move
module 0x2f60e33e33a1c880e8749073c5ef89288cf4df8974d8b872dfd72bc6c58f1172::nft {
// ...

// Arg0: String - nft name
// Arg1: String - nft description
// Arg2: String - nft img url
entry public mint(Arg0: String, Arg1: String, Arg2: String, Arg3: &mut TxContext) {
//...
}
}
```

In order to call the mint function of this contract, we first create a function that returns a `TransactionBlock` using Sui TS SDK.

```jsx
import { TransactionBlock } from '@mysten/sui';

function createMintNftTxnBlock() {
  // define a programmable transaction block
  const txb = new TransactionBlock();

  // note that this is a devnet contract address
  const contractAddress =
    '0x2f60e33e33a1c880e8749073c5ef89288cf4df8974d8b872dfd72bc6c58f1172';
  const contractModule = 'nft';
  const contractMethod = 'mint';

  const nftName = 'Razor NFT';
  const nftDescription = 'Hello, Razor NFT';
  const nftImgUrl =
    'https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYbAuxRGdSgNsfDopufzRrXsXfeuRsMnd1T1JR7qdi5Kn';

  txb.moveCall({
    target: `${contractAddress}::${contractModule}::${contractMethod}`,
    arguments: [tx.pure(nftName), tx.pure(nftDescription), tx.pure(nftImgUrl)],
  });

  return txb;
}
```

We've defined the smart contract target as well as the arguments, now it's time to create the transaction block and execute it. For clear explanation, I drew a diagram for showing the interaction process.

Okay, get back to the code. Let's create an async function that creates and sends the transaction to the wallet for signing and execution.

```jsx
import { useSuiWallet } from '@razorlabs/wallet-kit';
import { Transaction } from '@mysten/sui';

function createMintNftTxn() {
  // ...
}

export default function App() {
  const wallet = useSuiWallet();

  async function mintNft() {
    if (!wallet.connected) return;

    const txb = createMintNftTxn();
    try {
      // call the wallet to sign and execute the transaction
      const res = await wallet.signAndExecuteTransaction({
        transaction: txb,
      });
      console.log('nft minted successfully!', res);
      alert('Congrats! your nft is minted!');
    } catch (e) {
      alert('Oops, nft minting failed');
      console.error('nft mint failed', e);
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* ... */}
      {wallet.status === 'connected' && (
        <button onClick={mintNft}>Mint Your NFT !</button>
      )}
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

We've placed a button on the page which triggers the mintNft function, where it calls `wallet.signAndExecuteTransaction` to invoke the connected wallet to sign and execute the transaction request.

Finally, let's take Razor wallet for testing. First open your Razor Wallet, change the network to `devnet`.

Then click the button "Mint Your NFT!" to send the transaction to the wallet:

If everything works, you should see a popup saying "your nft is minted!". Now check the NFT section in your Razor wallet, you should see a beautiful Razor NFT there.

If you made this far, then congratulations! Your dapp is equipped with the power to interact with wallets and users. Don't hesitate, go and keep on making your dapp more interesting and powerful!
